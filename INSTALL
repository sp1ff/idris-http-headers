Installation Instructions
*************************

Basic Installation
==================

    idris-http-headers is a demonstration program; as such, it is not
really intended for installation. That said, it does contain an Idris
package file. I suggest you install Idris2 using ‘idris2-pack‘
(https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack), which can be installed
with the following shell command:

  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack/main/install.bash)"

Once ‘pack‘ is installed, the command ‘make‘ will build the package.
‘pack run‘ will invoke the package. ‘pack install‘ will install the
program, should that be desired.
